# fullstack
Full stack for frontend engineers, condensed in short notes. 

## Full Stack Engineer
Many definitions exist for this term (and many controversies), but a full stack engineer is someone who can build an application from start to end. 

It's a bit complicated to delve into the details as both frontend and backend technologies are expansive such that no one is truly super-grounded enough in all tech to call themselves truly full stack, but the term is a useful description of the disciplines you straddle. 

## Command Line Interface
It is an unbridled interface for talking with your computer at an OS level. Many people swap out CLIs for GUIs (Graphic User Interfaces), and that's a shame. GUIs are opinionated, and thus throttled. 

CLIs are fast, consistent and easier to automate. 

### Common commands for the CLI
cd - check directory
pwd - print working directory
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove directory
echo - return your input
etc

## Shell 
This is your command interpreter that interfaces with your system. 

Popular examples: bash, zsh. 

The shell is the frontline you interface with, which gives you access to the application (the OS, typically) which gives you access to the kernel (which is the core of the OS. It handles the communication with the machine layer.)

## How does the internet work?
The internet is 'a bunch of computers talking with eachother' using a bunch of requests and responses (a series of tubes). The world-wide web is simply a part of the internet. There's FTP, streaming, etc. 

The internet can also be thought of as a series of publicly internet-connected devices, which is what separates it from the intranet.
